* Epic

Epic is a small elisp to access Evernote process via AppleScript.
After load this file, you can:

  1) drag notes in Evernote to an Org-mode buffer.
  2) use M-x ``epic-anything'' for completion of Tag and Notebook.
  3) use M-x ``epic-insert-selected-note-as-org-links''
     for insertion of org-style links.

* Note for setup

  Since the current Evernote (2.2) does not have any interface to
  acquire note-links in the form of ``evernote://...'',
  Epic sends Control-L to make Evernote put the links to clipboard.
  So, you have to bind Control-L to ``copy note link'' within Evernote.
  Please set up your Mac referring to:
